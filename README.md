# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is a annual event in which various programming challenges are laid out for users to complete. In order to hone in on my familiarity with various programming languages and problems, I plan to start completing these when I have time available.

Each day is split into separate folders which consist of 2 problems each.
